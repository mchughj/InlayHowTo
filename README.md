# InlayHowTo
Occasionally I do laser cut inlays with thin woods.  It feels like every time I have had to re-learn how to make the inlays perfect accounting for the kerf of the laser.  I put together the svg file found in this repo that completely explains the problem and solution that I find very helpful to review before doing a laser inlay.  Including it here in case others have similar problems in wrapping their heads around this issue.
